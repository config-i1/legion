legion v0.2.2 (Release data: 2025-10-06)
=======

Changes:
* Updated C++ code to support backcasting.


legion v0.2.1 (Release data: 2025-02-03)
=======

Changes:
* We now use Matrix package for sparse matrix computations. Very useful for data with lots of series.
* We now calculate eigen values inside the C++ using the eigens_gen() function from the Armadillo library. This works faster but might produce less accurate estimates of parameters (need to experiment).

Bugfixes:
* Corrected the author details in the documentation.
* A fix in the stability checks for the admissible bounds for vets and ves.
* Correct number of degrees of freedom for vets/ves prediction intervals.
* Correct email address.


legion v0.2.0 (Release data: 2023-09-15)
=======

Changes:
* Starting from v0.2.0, the legion package for R will be released under the LGPLv2.1 license. The source of the older version of the software under the GPL(>=2) is available here: https://github.com/config-i1/legion/releases/tag/v0.1.3.


legion v0.1.3 (Release data: 2023-08-28)
=======

Changes:
* References to the accepted papers on VETS.


legion v0.1.2 (Release data: 2023-01-30)
=======

Changes:
* The order in which in plot.legion() now matters.
* Allow estimating seasonal vets() on the short data (one season of data).
* auto.vets() now does not check for common initial level and common level component. This is not practical.

Bugfixes:
* Fixed a bug in dimnames for some vets() models.
* ves() and vets() would produce an error in case of h=1 due to drop of one of the dimensions by R, when extracting the holdout.
* Fix in auto.vets() for level models with no checks for initials and components.
* measures() was not imported from greybox for some reason. Now it is.
* Different initialisation of persistence matrix in ves(), so that it does not get stuck in the violation of stability condition.


legion v0.1.1 (Release data: 2022-02-14)
=======

Changes:
* Usual bounds are now available in vets. This will make all parameters lie between 0 and 1.
* Custom loss function for both ves() and vets().
* We now import forecast from generics package, not from greybox.
* Correct names of states that include original names of time series in vets().

Bugfixes:
* forecast.legion would not work correctly if variables did not have names.


legion v0.1.0 (Release data: 2021-05-15)
=======

Changes:
* Imported ves() and vets() functions from smooth package.
* We now have explicit lags parameter in ves() and vets().
* First working version of vets().
* architectorVETS in vets() - internal function needed for selector.
* vets() and ves() now support model selection.
* vets() now has a proper likelihood estimation and implementation of multiplicative error model.
* ves() now also has a proper MLE.
* Parameter "silent" can now only be TRUE or FALSE.
* auto.vets() function, selecting PIC elements via I->P->C.
* plot() method for ves() and vets(). Currently only produces plots 1 and 4-7.
* Fixed BICc and AICc for multivariate models.
* loss="diagonal" now refers to likelihood maximisation, assuming that the series are independent.
* auto.vets() now starts with the model with loss="diagonal", implying that covariances are all zero.
* Substituted the parameters "y" with "data".
* A brief vignette for vets().
* plot.legion() method now supports all plots.
* forecast.legion() and related methods is now available.
* ves() and vets() now work with zoo classes of data.
* on.exit() restore par for plot functions.
