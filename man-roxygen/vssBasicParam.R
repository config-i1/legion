#' @param data The matrix with the data, where series are in columns and
#' observations are in rows.
#' @param h Length of forecasting horizon.
#' @param holdout If \code{TRUE}, holdout sample of size \code{h} is taken from
#' the end of the data.
#' @param ic The information criterion used in the model selection procedure.
#' @param silent If \code{silent="none"}, then nothing is silent, everything is
#' printed out and drawn. \code{silent="all"} means that nothing is produced or
#' drawn (except for warnings). In case of \code{silent="graph"}, no graph is
#' produced. If \code{silent="legend"}, then legend of the graph is skipped.
#' And finally \code{silent="output"} means that nothing is printed out in the
#' console, but the graph is produced. \code{silent} also accepts \code{TRUE}
#' and \code{FALSE}. In this case \code{silent=TRUE} is equivalent to
#' \code{silent="all"}, while \code{silent=FALSE} is equivalent to
#' \code{silent="none"}. The parameter also accepts first letter of words ("n",
#' "a", "g", "l", "o").
